Using this and changing your boot logo is at your own risk.

The logos included have been tested and do not brick our devices. The app should also recognize a logo not the correct size. But again please use with caution if you are using your own custom made logos.

Place your bootlogo.bmp image here and overwrite the current file. Make sure it is rotated just like the current spruce example and named bootlogo.bmp. Run the app to change your boot logo with the one located here.
