thanks to Steward-Fu for his custom sdl code: https://github.com/steward-fu/sdl2

NOTE: you need buy pico8 raspberry pi 32bit code and put pico8_dyn and pico8.dat in App/Pico/bin in your sdcard. The local roms in the sdcard need rename the extension of .png to .p8.png for works in the emulator. Place your games in PICO8 Rom folder.
