You need to place your Pico-8 dat and dyn files in the bin folder of the Pico App for Pico-8 games to launch using native Pico-8.
We strongly encourage you to buy and support Pico-8. https://www.lexaloffle.com/pico-8.php?#getpico8


If you do not have the dat and dyn files to play Pico-8 here then you need to use FAKE08. Please reference that Rom folder.
  

USING THIS PICO8

PICO-8 games will launch native from the roms folder. Place your games in the PICO8 Roms folder as they are from the Pico-8 website. You need to provide your own dat and dyn files and place them in the bin folder located in sdcard/App/PICO/bin. You can also use splore with Wi-Fi to browse and play games by launching it from the App. There are so many wonderful games and they seem to just keep getting better. Pico-8 is a great way for indie game makers to create and share with the world. We cannot say enough good things about Pico-8. Enjoy!
