# spruce: *SD Card Overhaul for Miyoo A30* 

  - Spruce is not really an operating system (OS) on its own.
  - We think spruce is best described as being a beautification and optimization of the stock Miyoo OS that cleans up bloat, optimizes performance and focuses on aesthetics.
  - Spruce is intended to be sleek, intuitive, efficient and user friendly, we hope that you enjoy it.

## RETROARCH

  - Please do not adjust the settings in Retroarch unless you are very familiar with it.
  - Removing or changing settings may cause games or controls to not work correctly.
  - The "Default" settings are from Miyoo and will remove all the custom configuration that has been done for spruce.

## THEMES

  - Included are six themes located in Settings. More icons and themes are planned to be added in the future.
  - You can add themes from your Miyoo Mini or MMP. NOTE: There will be some missing assets because the A30 has additional ones.
  - We are seeking out new themes and hoping to get some soon! If you are interested in contributing a theme please reach out!
  - Initial work has began creating a [Theme Guide](https://github.com/spruceUI/spruceOS/wiki/Theme-design-guide)
