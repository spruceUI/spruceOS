Spruce 3.0.0: The Game Switcher update


 Changes/Additions:
 ● GameSwitcher: This can be used by holding the home key while using a game.
 Currently, the only games available in the Game Switcher will be those that you
 intentionally add to it, which is done by launching the Game Switcher while in-game.
 .(They can also be removed with Y while in GS.) We took this approach so it's not filled
 with games you don't care about, or only those you have recently opened. This is highly
 configurable with a lot of options in the new Advanced Settings app. This is our initial
 version so we'll be looking at feedback for future updates. (Oscar, Ry, Cinethezs)
 ● New'Advanced Settings' app: This has replaced a number of previous standalone
 apps, and is where you can set specific settings for the system, including some
 RetroArch settings, enabling Network apps (Such as Syncthing, Samba, SSH), and
 selecting which apps are visible in your apps folder. (Oscar)
 ● AutoSave/Shutdown/Resume: Moved to holding the power key. Now when holding the
 power key, you will get an autosave and shutdown screen. This is compatible with
 PPSSPP, DraStic and RA emulators. (When the A30 vibrates, it's entering auto save;
 holding it longer will initiate a force shutdown, so let go when it vibrates) (Team Effort)
 ● Syncthing Sync Checker: This is a new approach to Syncthing we are trying out. Our
 hope is this becomes a gold standard for Syncthing implementations. When Syncthing is
 configured and enabled (In Advanced Settings), we will now show a screen and check
 that your Syncthing state is synced, when shutting down, launching games, or resuming
 from shutdown. This will allow you to safely shutdown mid game and be sure the
 save/state is synced with other devices. On auto resume it will also check the sync state
 so you can be sure you’re playing the latest version. (BaseCase)
 ● Samba: InAdvanced Settings > Network tab you’ll find Samba. You can connect to this
 by going to your A30’s IP address in a file explorer, like “\\10.0.0.10” Username ‘root’
 Password ‘tina’. (FragBait)
 ● ThemeUnpacker: Going forward themes will come packed to allow a smaller install size
 and faster transfers! If any packed themes are found on startup they'll be automatically
 unpacked for use. (XanXic)
 ● Firmware Update App: This is a new app that will only show to users who aren’t on the
 latest version. If you see this in your apps, that’s you! This should walk you through
 preparing your A30 for the current Miyoo firmware update, which includes vital
 improvements to the A30’s WiFi capabilities. (Ry)
 ● AutoUpdater App: This app will show when you have a proper update file on your SD
 card. This is only going to be useful to you for the next update, but it can be used to
 reinstall much cleaner. This is also a huge hurdle done for future OTA updates. (XanXic)
 ● Multiple Wifi Networks: We now support multiple wifi networks on the A30. There are
 two implementations. One is to predefine them in the multipass.cfg file before startup.
 This will be consumed and deleted on startup. Otherwise setting your wifi through the
 A30’s native settings screen will now save to a list. If this causes issues a “Forget wifi
 networks” task exists in Advanced Settings (Cinethezs, FragBait, Ry)
 ● Battery Percent Display: Toggled in the Settings app. We can now show the
 percentage of the battery in the corner next to the icon (Cinethezs)
● SyncRTCwithnetwork: This is a new setting in Advanced Settings. It will automatically
 sync your system and RTC time based on your IP’s geolocation. (FragBait, XanXic)
 ● Disabled Wifi/Network apps in game: New in the settings app, you can now set it so
 wifi and/or network apps shutdown automatically while in game and will resume when
 you exit. (FragBait)
 ● ShutdownwhenIdle: This is a setting in the settings app. Set an amount of time when
 idle to save/shutdown the A30 automatically. By default, your A30 will power down when
 inactive for (5) minutes at the main menu, or (30) minutes within a supported emulator
 (adjustable in settings) to conserve battery. (FragBait)
 ● CodeandCPUoptimizations and other under-the-hood Emu changes.
 ● New"Smart" CPU mode- no more need to micromanage clock speeds- the A30 will do
 it for you! This is the new default, spruce-recommended setting for all supported
 systems.(Ry)
 ● Cleaned up Xbutton menu in game list. (Ry)
 ● Addedability to set cores and CPU mode on per-game basis in X button menu. (Ry)
 ● Addedadditional core options for systems and core changes (Ry, Cobalt, KMFDManic,
 Metallic77):
 ○ FDS:Nestopia added
 ○ 32X:Genesis Plus GX added
 ○ N64:KMLudicrousN64 Xtreme Amped, KM Parallel X-A Turbo
 ○ Amigadefault core changed to UAE4ARM
 ○ Atari ST added (Hatari core)
 ○ SG-1000/SMS/GG default core changed to Genesis Plus GX
 ○ PSX:Duckswanstation Xtreme Amped added
 ● MovedSplore (Pico-8) out of Apps and into top of Pico-8 game list. (Ry)
 ● Newunified Hotkeys configured for RetroArch, we updated them to what we would
 consider a 'common' layout and to make them compatible with our new use of the home
 key. (Ry)
 ○ SELECT+A=Screenshot
 ○ SELECT+B=Exit toMainUI
 ○ SELECT+X=OpenMenu
 ○ SELECT+Y=ToggleFPS
 ○ SELECT+L1=LoadState
 ○ SELECT+R1=SaveState
 ○ SELECT+L2=ToggleSlow Motion
 ○ SELECT+R2=ToggleFast Forward
 ○ SELECT+Up/Down=Cycle through shaders
 ○ SELECT+Left/Right = Cycle through state slots
 ● Enabled the ability to download certain things in RetroArch like system files, assets, and
 free content. (Ry)
 ● Automatic Icon refresh: previously this required running an app. This will now happen
 when you change themes; app removed. (XanXic)
● Automatic EmuFresh: previously this required running an app. When a change is
 detected with your rom set this will refresh the rom and console list automatically. (Ry,
 Oscar, Alpha)
 ● Automatic Install Heal attempt: This is a script that runs in a few places, like launching
 an app or game that will check your install and make an attempt to heal/fix it. This isn’t a
 fix for anything but mostly a fix for clash between the stock firmware and spruce. But
 should help a few people. (Ry)
 ● PPSSPP:Underclock setting updated and disabled anisotropic filtering to improve
 performance. (Cobalt)
 ● SpruceBackup/Restore: updated to move Pico 8 bios and Syncthing configs to their
 new locations. (XanXic)
 ● Dingux/File Manger: Themed to match Spruce’s theme. (Cinethezs)
 ● Italian and Albanian languages added. (369px)
 ● NewShadersadded. (Metallic77)
 ● Addedversion number to translation files that we'll keep up to date hopefully. (Ry)
 ● Logsupdated to make a new log file on boot and keep the last 5 boot cycles. These can
 be helpful for the Spruce team to help you with issues, so be sure to grab them if you
 have problems. General logger improvements. (XanXic)
 ● Credits app added. (App by Cinethezs, Music: Sweater Ass Sounding Ass (Demo) and
 Sir Daniel Bonaduce (Demo) by Our Ghosts, ourghosts.bandcamp.com)
 ● MovedFFPlay & Videos folders to Media, small improvements to FFPlay
 (SundownerSport, XanXic)
 ● Syncthing App removed, code remade, and integrated more deeply into spruce and
 hooks for Syncthing Sync Checker (XanXic)
 ● CosyThemeadded (KyleBing)
 ● Newbinary for showing images (Cinethezs)
 ● Newbinary for file changes (Inotify) (Cinethezs, Oscar)
 ● Unified all our on screen information screens, paving the path for theming them
 dynamically in the next update (Cinethezs, Ry, XanXic)
 ● Newhighresolution icons added and utilized (Sundowner, Ry) (Icons provided by
 Icons8.com, and with official support given to the Spruce team.)
 ● Further reduced spruce's install size (Team effort)
 Bug Fixes/Removals:
 ● Off the bat, tons of under the hood improvements to performance and reliability. You
 should see improved boot and game launch times compared to 2.3.0. In some cases
 drastically improved.
 ● Alotof standalone apps were removed and moved into our new Advanced Settings
 Apps. These include EmuFresh, Expert App Switch, IconFresh, LEDOn, RecentSwitch,
 RetroExpert, SSH, Syncthing, and Wifi File Transfer. (XanXic)
 ● SpruceBackup made self reliant so it can be used in a broken state (XanXic)
 ● Lowpowerwarning: Reduced vibration to just two cycles, LED will continue to blink
 until power is above 4%, a popup will now appear on the main menu after some time
 (XanXic)
● Fixfor network apps startup being slightly resource intensive and occasionally unreliable
 (FragBait)
 ● Fixed Miyoo interfering with CPU governor. This was more of an issue with 3.0.0’s more
 advanced tweaking of these but this also affected our initial version of this in 2.3.0. (Ry,
 Oscar)
 ● Fixed apps not being able to be added to favorites (Cinethezs)
 ● Fixed analog stick use in PPSSPP, go AngryBirds all you want (Oscar)
 ● Fixed analog stick use in PSX games (Oscar, Cobalt)
 ● Allowing analog stick use in Pico-8 Native (Oscar)
 ● Enable use of Analog Stick within the main menu and applications (Oscar)
 ● Fixed brightness not being consistent across reboots. (FragBait)
 ● Fixed audio not adjusting consistently across modes (FragBait)
 ●
 ● Fixed Polish translation (S3V3Npl)
 ● Fixed Boxart Scraper app only checking for wifi being turned on and not verifying an
 actual connection. (Fragbait79)
 ● RemovedRetroArch Expert App: With this update we now have a new hotkey layout so
 we no longer have a concept of expert/normal modes with RA. Hotkeys should be
 enabled by default now after a fresh install or restore. Then in settings you can adjust to
 the home key opening the RetroArch menu by changing the setting in Advanced
 Settings (XanXic)
 ● (Re)Moved all ports except DinoJump and 2048 to our new Spruce Ports repo. This was
 done to decrease the initial install size.
 https://github.com/spruceUI/Ports-and-Free-Games (Ry)
 ● Drastic cleanup of the Emu folder and RetroArch folder (Ry)
 ● Removedspare icon packs, fallback icons set to minimalist white set (XanXic,
 Sundowner)
 ● RemovedScummVMBios(These are available in our ports Repo)
 ● Removedmame2003_xtreme and km_mame2003_xtreme libretro cores that weren't
 being used (Ry)
 ● Movedtoour new binary for showing images, and removed all previous calls. Improving
 performance and ease of use on our end. (Ry, XanXic)
