Updating Firmware:

Download and Extract the Firmware.

Format a spare microSD card to FAT32.

Copy+Paste the Firmware onto the microSD card.

Eject the card and insert it into your A30.

Plug it into a charging brick, NOT A COMPUTER.

Turn it on (there will be a little Rocket Ship and a loading bar) and wait for it to finish. It will turn off on its own.

Eject and set aside the Firmware card and reinsert your spruce card into your A30.
